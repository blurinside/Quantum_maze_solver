Quantum Maze Solver
This project implements a quantum walk simulator to solve a maze using Qiskit for quantum circuit simulation and Tkinter for graphical representation. The maze solver utilizes quantum principles to explore possible paths through the maze.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Qiskit
Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)
Installation
Install Python from python.org.
Install Qiskit by running:
bash
Copy code
pip install qiskit
Ensure Tkinter is installed (it typically comes pre-installed with Python). If not, follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
Usage
Save the following code in a Python file, for example, quantum_maze_solver.py:
python
Copy code
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit as QC
from qiskit_aer import AerSimulator

import tkinter as tk

    def __init__(self, master):
        self.master = master

        self.canvas_height = 300

        self.canvas = tk.Canvas(master, width=self.canvas_width, height=self.canvas_height)
        self.canvas.pack()

        self.run_simulation()

    def draw_maze(self, maze):
        cell_width = self.canvas_width / len(maze[0])
        cell_height = self.canvas_height / len(maze)

        for i in range(len(maze)):
            for j in range(len(maze[0])):
                x0, y0 = j * cell_width, i * cell_height
                x1, y1 = (j + 1) * cell_width, (i + 1) * cell_height
                if maze[i][j] == 1:
                    self.canvas.create_rectangle(x0, y0, x1, y1, fill="black")

        cell_height = self.canvas_height / len(maze)

        for i, j in path:
            x0, y0 = j * cell_width + cell_width / 4, i * cell_height + cell_height / 4
            x1, y1 = (j + 1) * cell_width - cell_width / 4, (i + 1) * cell_height - cell_height / 4

        maze = [
            [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
            [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
            [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
            [0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
            [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]

        ]

        
        num_qubits = 10  

        # Initialize the quantum circuit
        qc = QC(num_qubits, num_qubits)  
        for i in range(len(maze)):
            for j in range(len(maze[0])):
                if maze[i][j] == 0:  
                    # Encode the current position in the maze using qubits
                    qc.x(i)  # Set the qubit corresponding to the row index to |1>
                    qc.x(len(maze) + j)  

                   
                    qc.h(i)
                    qc.h(len(maze) + j)

                    
                    qc.measure(i, i)  
                    qc.measure(len(maze) + j, len(maze) + j)  

                   
                    qc.reset(i)
                    qc.reset(len(maze) + j)

       
        simulator = AerSimulator()
        result = simulator.run(qc).result()

      

        # Draw the maze and the path
        self.draw_maze(maze)
        self.draw_path(maze, [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4)])  

root = tk.Tk()
my_gui = QuantumWalkGUI(root)
root.mainloop()
Run the script using Python:
bash
Copy code
python quantum_maze_solver.py
How It Works
Maze Representation: The maze is represented as a 2D list where 0 indicates an open path and 1 indicates a wall.
Quantum Circuit Initialization: A quantum circuit is created with a number of qubits proportional to the maze's size.
Quantum Walk Simulation: Quantum operations are applied to simulate the exploration of the maze.
Visualization: Tkinter is used to create a graphical interface displaying the maze and the solution path.
Note
This implementation demonstrates the concept of a quantum walk for maze solving but does not perform a complete quantum computation for pathfinding. It combines classical pathfinding logic with quantum circuit representation for educational purposes.
